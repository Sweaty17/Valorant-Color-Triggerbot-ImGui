Valorant Color Triggerbot made with a shitty ImGui 

Hi

I just wanted to make a Working Color triggerbot for valorant that will not get u banned and is free, but with my i dont know any C++ so i just took my python code asked chattgpt to convert it in C++ and tada its working its not this good but its working
i tried to add color selection but its not working for me couse if i select other color (rgb code) then Purple the searcherino funktion stops working or gets really slow at it.

if you want to optimize the code or you could help me pls add me on dc: sweaty5406

other way i hope you like my little triggerbot and dont get banned.

as far only 15 ppl used my trigger without bann but still use at own Risk TY
